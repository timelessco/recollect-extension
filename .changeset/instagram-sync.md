**Sync your Instagram saves to Recollect**

Your Instagram saved posts now sync to Recollect with one click. Collections you've organized on Instagram carry over automatically.

**What's new**
- One-click Instagram sync from the extension popup
- Instagram collections mapped to Recollect collections automatically
- Incremental sync — only fetches new saves since your last sync
- Live progress during fetching and uploading
- Cancel sync anytime — already-uploaded posts are kept
- Resume paused syncs right where you left off
- Browser notification when sync finishes in the background
- Smart retry with countdown on rate limits or connection issues

**What's better**
- "Last synced: X ago" shows when you last synced
- "Already up to date" when there's nothing new
- Extension auto-creates an Instagram tab if none is open
- Content script survives extension reloads — no need to refresh Instagram

**What's fixed**
- Sync status now updates correctly even when no new posts are found
